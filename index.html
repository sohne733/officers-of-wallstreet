    <h1 class="hover-title">OFFICERS OF WALL STREET</h1>
    <p class="hover-text">Walking down Wall Street, I noticed two officers standing in front of the New York Stock Exchange. They looked sharp in their uniforms, laughing while having a conversation. I knew that moment I wanted to capture that special bond so I decided to ask if I could take their picture. I hesitated for a moment, unsure of how they’d respond. But when I asked, their faces lit up with smiles. “Of course!” one of them said, laughing as they straightened up for the photo. They were surprisingly kind, far from the stern expressions I had expected. I thanked them, and as I walked away, I realized that the officers of Wall Street weren’t just guardians of the financial district—they were a friendly part of the city’s fabric, always open to small, human connections like this and sharing a laugh.</p>
